### CONFIGURATION
#
# Declarations here you can customize to your preferred setup.
# Generally only if you actually have to. Check Wiki for details.
#
###

# SQLite3 ChristmasPlus 2.32.2 database.db file is expected,
# if you have renamed it, change that here obviously.
# you can also set a full path like /full/path/to/database.db
_databaseFile="./database.db"

# If no param is provided, we fall back to a default username
# can be uuid
_user="mrfloris"

# output to a log file?
_log=true
_logFile="christmasplus-results.log"
