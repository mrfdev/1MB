### CONFIGURATION
#
# All other configuration should be done in the 1MB-ChristmasPlus.sh file from floris
# All this file does is run floris' script in a loop.
#

# SQLite3 ChristmasPlus 2.32.2 database.db file is expected,
# if you have renamed it, change that here obviously.
# you can also set a full path like /full/path/to/database.db
_databaseFile="./database.db"

# Function for handling errors

    local message="$1"
    echo "Error: $message"
    exit 1

# Lets exit if jq is not found, since we depend on it
if ! command -v jq &> /dev/null; then
    printf "Could not find 'jq' installed. Install 'jq' to proceed. 'brew install jq' on macOS or 'apt install jq' on Ubuntu\n"
    exit 1

# Does the expected database.db file exist in the same directory?
if [ ! -f "$_databaseFile" ]; then
    echo "Error: '$_databaseFile' not found in the current directory."

# And based on length of username, assume uuid or username, and update query accordingly.

# The query we need to retrieve the list of players who have claimed at least one gift
    query="SELECT name FROM players WHERE claimedGifts LIKE '%true%' ORDER BY upper(name);"
    printf "Syntax: %s <any|complete>\n" "$0"
    printf "Description: Get player gift data from the ChristmasPlus '$_databaseFile' database.\n"
    printf "Description: For either any participate or only those who missed no gifts.\n"
    printf "Example: We are going to gather output for those that collected any gifts."

elif [ "$_paramParticpationLevel" == "complete" ]; then
# The query we need to retrieve the list of players who have claimed at least one gift

# We want to check case insensitive
_columnName="name COLLATE NOCASE"
_columnQueryFor="name" # only used visually




# Now that we know the database.db fle exists, and the query to run, lets connect and build a result
result=$(sqlite3 "$_databaseFile" "$query")

# Check if there is a result to work with and, if so, run the script once per name found
if [ -n "$result" ]; then
    for name in $result ;  do ./1MB-ChristmasPlus.sh $name; done

    printf "Oops, no players found that matched in that database."
