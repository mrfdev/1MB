# Restricted area configuration
#
# Configures restricted areas where you cannot get experience or money
# when performing a job.
#
# The multiplier changes the experience/money gains in an area.
# A multiplier of 0.0 means no bonus, while 0.5 means you will get 50% more the normal income
# While -0.5 means that you will get 50% less the normal income
#
# jobs section defines list of jobs this area should apply to
# Define it as [jobName/all]-[fromLevel]-[untilLevel] for example miner-5-10 would mean that this area applies for miners between level 5 and 10
# Level limits are optional and if not defined we will apply to all levels
# You can define for all jobs at same time with defined level limit like all-25-69 which would apply for all jobs between level 25 and 69
