###

# Save the Paper .jar to a default directory
# Default is "." for saving it to current
# Example 1 "./server"
# Example 2 "/full/path/to/server" 
# Startup param -d will override this
_saveDir="."

# CURL params explained
# -f : This option tells curl to fail silently if the HTTP status code returned by the server is >= 400. This means that if the request returns a status code indicating an error (such as 404 Not Found), curl will simply return an error code and not print any output.
# -L : This option tells curl to follow any redirects that the server sends in the response. If the server returns a redirect status code (such as 301 Moved Permanently) and the Location header, curl will automatically make a new request to the URL specified in the Location header.
# -s : This option tells curl to run in "silent" mode, which means that it will not print any progress information or error messages to the console.
# -X 'GET' : This option tells curl to use the GET method for the request. This is the default method, so you could also leave this option out.
# -H 'accept: application/json' : This option sets the value of the Accept header in the request to "application/json". This tells the server that the client is expecting a JSON response.
