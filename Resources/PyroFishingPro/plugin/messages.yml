        &lWhat is Crabmas?&r

        Crabmas is all about trying to find a special Crab that will spawn in a random biome, finding enough orbs, and killing the special boss for loot.
      - "&lHow do I take part?&r\n\nAll you need to do is catch a fish in different\
        \ biomes. If you are lucky, you will find the special crab in your biome.\
        \ If you do, it will then announce it to everyone, and the crab will stay\
        \ in that location for one hour. "
      - After that hour, it will move to a random biome to repeat the cycle. Killing
        the mini &cCrabmas &rwill give you a &cCrabmas Orb&r. If you use &45 &rof
        these by &2right-clicking in air&r, it will make the next one you find be
        the &cCrabmas Boss&r. This boss has a few special attacks. Upon killing it,
        you will get
      - one of fourteen random drops. Check the next page for a detailed droplist.
