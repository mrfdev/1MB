# 1MB BuildTools Shell Script

A little helper that I use on my macOS 26+ and Ubuntu 20+ systems to help me automatically run the steps to get buildtools, and build the desired Spigot jar.

## Deprecated

![Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-deprecated-red)

> ⚠️ **Deprecated** – This script is no longer actively maintained.

As of our full migration to the [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) engine, this script has been **deprecated** and will not receive further updates or support. Paper has officially hard-forked away from SpigotMC and now provides early experimental builds at the same time (or earlier) than Spigot, making this script redundant for our current needs.

We are currently in a grace period where the script may still be kept up-to-date with minor changes, but no new features will be added. The project will eventually be archived.

You're welcome to fork, modify, or use the script as-is, but future compatibility is not guaranteed.

Thanks to everyone who used, starred, or contributed over time.
